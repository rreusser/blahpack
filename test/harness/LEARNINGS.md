# Validation Learnings

**This file is the proof that the validation harness is actionable, not vanity.**
Every bug the property/fuzzing harness catches gets a permanent entry here, with a
reproducible trigger and the root cause. Over time this becomes a catalog of the
*classes* of error that survive naive fixture testing — which is exactly the
intelligence that lets us harden the tooling and the modules.

## MANDATORY LOGGING RULE (read before you "just fix it")

> When the harness (or any test) surfaces a defect, **you MUST add an entry to
> this file BEFORE or ALONGSIDE the fix** — never fix silently. This applies to
> bugs in a translated routine AND bugs in the harness itself. A fix without a
> learning throws away the most valuable output of the whole exercise: knowing
> what kind of mistake was made and where else it might hide.

Each entry MUST contain:

1. **What** — the routine (or harness component) and the symptom.
2. **Repro** — the exact trigger: scalar type, storage scheme, `uplo`/`trans`/
   `diag`, dimensions, and the **RNG seed**. A reader must be able to reproduce it
   from the entry alone.
3. **Root cause** — the specific indexing/branch/convention error, quoted if
   possible.
4. **Bug class** — one of: `off-by-one`, `0-vs-1-index`, `wrong-branch`,
   `row-col-transpose`, `stride-sign`, `uplo/trans/diag-handling`,
   `storage-mapping`, `tolerance`, `convention`, `other`.
5. **Generalization** — "where else might this hide?" Name sibling routines or
   storage schemes to check next. This is the payoff.

Keep entries short. Newest first.

## 2026-07-15 — harness packed-scheme lower-triangle index collision

- **What**: `schemes.packed` produced NaN outputs from `dspmv`/`zhpmv` with
  `uplo='lower'` at small `n`. Caught by `assertFinite` (poisoned storage) during
  the harness's own bring-up.
- **Repro**: real scalar, packed scheme, `uplo='lower'`, `n=2`, any seed. Logical
  element `(1,1)` and `(1,0)` both mapped to packed index 1.
- **Root cause**: lower-triangle column-start term written as
  `j*(2N - j - 1)/2`; correct term is `j*(2N - j + 1)/2` (i.e.
  `j*N - j*(j-1)/2`). The sign error collapsed two distinct elements onto one
  slot, so the routine read an unwritten (NaN-poisoned) slot.
- **Bug class**: `storage-mapping` / `off-by-one`.
- **Generalization**: audit every other place that hand-codes the packed
  lower-triangle index (band-storage lower map, any `sp`/`hp`/`tp` reconstruction
  helper). Confirmed the upper formula `i + j*(j+1)/2` is correct. This is *the*
  reason the packed scheme poisons unused slots — an index collision reads a NaN
  instead of silently returning a plausible-but-wrong number.
